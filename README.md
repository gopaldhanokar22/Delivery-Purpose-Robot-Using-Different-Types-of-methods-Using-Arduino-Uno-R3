Delivery Purpose Robot Using Different Types of methods Using Arduino Uno R3

The project is design to Delivery robot build a line following, obstacle avoidance, IR remote control, voice control, light following, human following, using some different type of sensors for its movement. Arduino uno and different ICs used to achieve the desired operation. A robot is a machine that can perform task automatically or with guidance. The project proposes robot that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path. This robot is built, using Arduino. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect any obstacle ahead of it and sends a command to the Arduino. Depending on the input signal received, the Arduino redirects the robot to move in an alternate direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it through a motor driver. At the same time, we can control steering gear to realize the obstacle avoidance function. That is one function on robot similar as different type of function also perform. The robot uses front axle steering, rear wheel drive arrangement. Four drive tires are driven by Four DC motors with gear reduction mechanisms.
